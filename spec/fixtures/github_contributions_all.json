I'm using this in production currently and it's working quite well.\r\n\r\nOn the project which this is extracted from, I'm comparing the rendered text to a fixture using [a library I cobbled together from some example code](https://github.com/nickcharlton/image-comparer). It uses `System.Drawing.Common`, rather than `ImageSharp` so one option would be for me to refactor that then use it here, but I'm open to any thoughts on that.\r\n\r\nAnother problem with testing is needing a `ttf` font. A good choice here might be to bundle an open source font for this purpose, but I'm open to ideas.\r\n\r\nFinally, it's in the command emitters for images, which felt the most appropriate for what it's doing but it could easily go somewhere else.",
