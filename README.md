ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nick (he/him), I maintain [Administrate][1], [Appraisal][2] and a [bunch
of other things][3].

I'm a developer and Team Lead at [thoughtbot][4], where I do a combination of
leading projects, managing a team and helping clients ship excellent software.
Talk to me if you're interested in working with us, or joining thoughtbot!

I'm often a bit slow at responding, so give me time, I do get to it eventually.
